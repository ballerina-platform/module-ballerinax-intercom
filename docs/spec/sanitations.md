# Sanitation for OpenAPI specification

This document records the sanitation done on top of the official OpenAPI specification from Intercom. 
The OpenAPI specification is obtained from the [Intercom OpenAPI Documentation](https://github.com/intercom/Intercom-OpenAPI).
These changes are done in order to improve the overall usability, and as workarounds for some known language limitations.


1. Remove error responses from the following operations,
  - DataEventSummaries
  - CreateDataEvent
  - DeleteTagHeaders
 

## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/openapi.json --license docs/license.txt -o ballerina --use-sanitized-oas
```
Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2024, change if necessary.
